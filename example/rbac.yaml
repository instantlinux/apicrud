#
# Privacy:
#  While default permissions are defined by role, a resource can
#  open wider access using these privacy options:
#
#  secret (default - based on roles defined here)
#  manager = read/write by designated resource managers
#  invitee = read by any invitee to the resource (e.g. list)
#             (or TODO: by anyone invited to join list_id)
#  member = read by confirmed member
#             (or TODO: by any member attached to list_id)
#  public = read by anyone
#
# Keyword substitution:
#  Put initialization keywords in curly braces; runtime keywords in
#  doubled curly braces.
#
#  list_id = list id
#  resource = resource type
#  uid = user id
